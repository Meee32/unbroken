Why did we create it ?

i was involved in another Cryptocurrency project and that project ran into some design limitations that the Dev didn't want to change and when we asked him to we were told if we thought we could do it better we were more than welcome to try to do it ourselves, So we did.

Specifictions 

Unbrokencoin is a POW Sha256d
Here is our answer to the 2016 BLock retargeting that we thought was too long for a Altcoin, So we have a 2 block retarget.

We sped up the number of confirmations from 120 - 60 so that miners wouldn't have to wait for extended periods of time to receive there rewards.

Fast Block times 120 seconds

Halving Every Four years or 4000000 Blocks

Total of 80 Million coins

Development process

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new official, stable release versions of Unbrokencoin.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
